## Setup

⚠️ It is recommended to create a separate folder for the course and keep the same folder architecture as in the GitHub repo. There are two easy ways to do that:

* If you are familiar with ```git```, simply do ```git clone https://github.com/ku-dviz/2024.git```.
* Otherwise, download a .zip bundle of the repository [here](https://github.com/ku-dviz/2024/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and decompress the file wherever you would like.
